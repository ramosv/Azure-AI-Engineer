# Azure AI Engineer

Design and implement an Azure AI solution using Azure AI Services, Azure AI Search, and Azure OpenAI.

You will need Azure credits to complete this course. I am using the GitHub Student Developer Pack, which provides university students with \$100 worth of Azure creditsâ€”without requiring a credit card or any form of payment.
